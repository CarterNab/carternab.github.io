    "text": "Since winning it all, the Royals have strung together some rather atrocious seasons. To be a playoff caliber ball club, you must excel on both sides of the game, offense and defense which the Royals haven’t seemed to do.\nThe story that I’m aiming to tell here is the downfall of the Kansas City Royals since winning the World Series in 2015. I hypothesize that since 2015 the Royals have fallen well below average in three different phases of the game: Pitching, Fielding, and Batting. In order to investigate the Royals on these three phases, we need to look at change over time (2015-2022). The metrics I’ve chosen to look at are Earned Run Average (ERA) for Pitching, Defensive Efficiency (% of balls in play converted into outs) for Fielding, and Batting Average (hits/at bats) for Batting.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npitching15 <- read_csv(\"pitchingdata2015.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2015)\npitching16 <- read_csv(\"pitchingdata2016.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2016)\npitching17 <- read_csv(\"pitchingdata2017.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2017)\npitching18 <- read_csv(\"pitchingdata2018.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2018)\npitching19 <- read_csv(\"pitchingdata2019.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2019)\npitching20 <- read_csv(\"pitchingdata2020.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2020)\npitching21 <- read_csv(\"pitchingdata2021.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2021)\npitching22 <- read_csv(\"pitchingdata2022.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2022)\n\npitching <- bind_rows(pitching15, pitching16, pitching17, pitching18, pitching19, pitching20, pitching21, pitching22)\n\nyalsP<- pitching %>% \n  filter(Tm ==\"Kansas City Royals\") \n  averageERA<- pitching %>% \n    group_by(Season) %>% \n    summarise(mean_ERA=mean(ERA))\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=pitching, aes(x=Season, y=ERA, group=Tm), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=yalsP, aes(x=Season, y=ERA), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_line(data=averageERA, aes(x=Season, y=mean_ERA), color=\"black\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(2, 6)) +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Year\", \n    y=\"ERA\", \n    title=\"Royals Pitching Has Suffered Since Winning It All\", \n    subtitle=\"KC's Average ERA isn't stacking up against the competition\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference | By Carter Nab\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nBased on each MLB team’s Earned Run Average the only seasons the Royals were better than the average was in 2015(World Series Champs), and 2020(Covid-19 season).\nIt’s clear that the strength of the Royals bullpen isn’t what it was in 2015, as they appear to be continually moving away from the average year after year with exception to the shortened Covid-19 season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nfielding15 <- read_csv(\"fieldingdata2015.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2015)\nfielding16 <- read_csv(\"fieldingdata2016.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2016)\nfielding17 <- read_csv(\"fieldingdata2017.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2017)\nfielding18 <- read_csv(\"fieldingdata2018.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2018)\nfielding19 <- read_csv(\"fieldingdata2019.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2019)\nfielding20 <- read_csv(\"fieldingdata2020.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2020)\nfielding21 <- read_csv(\"fieldingdata2021.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2021)\nfielding22 <- read_csv(\"fieldingdata2022.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nfielding <- bind_rows(fielding15, fielding16, fielding17, fielding18, fielding19, fielding20, fielding21, fielding22)\n\nyalsD<- fielding %>% \n  filter(Tm ==\"Kansas City Royals\") %>%\n  select(Season, Tm, DefEff) %>%\n  mutate(teamseason=paste(Season, Tm))\naverageDefEff<- fielding %>% \n    group_by(Season) %>% \n  summarise(DefEff=mean(DefEff)) %>% \n  mutate(Tm=\"Average\")\n\ncombined<- bind_rows(yalsD, averageDefEff) %>% \n  mutate(teamseason=paste(Season, Tm))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=combined, aes(x=reorder(teamseason,-Season), weight=DefEff, group=Tm), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=yalsD, aes(x=reorder(teamseason,-Season), weight=DefEff), fill=\"#004687\") +\n  #geom_line(data=yalsD, aes(x=Season, y=DefEff), color=\"blue\") +\n  #geom_line(data=averageDefEff, aes(x=Season, y=mean_DefEff), color=\"black\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\", \n    y=\"Defensive Efficiency\", \n    title=\"Royals Defense is Below Average Since 2015\", \n    subtitle=\"KC's Defense needs some help if they want to ever make it to the playoffs again\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference | By Carter Nab\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nhex= #004687 Defensive Efficiency calculates the percentage of balls hit into play that are turned into outs.
